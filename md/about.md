The Rijksmuseum has about 1,000 images depicting specific locations in Amsterdam between 1550 and 1750.
Amsterdam expanded rapidly during this period. Successive fortifications and ring canals were built out from the medieval core of the city.
My core question is this: how did artists react to this periodic expansion? Did they turn their attention immediately towards new construction, or focus on old areas of the city, or some combination of both?
Was it possible to design an experiment that could use the Rijksmuseum data to explore this question?
Visualizing the spatial relationships of these depictions is leading me to now ask more detailed questions about why certain areas of the city may have attracted depiction while others did not.

You may filter the map below by time period as well as by place category. A plot displays the frequency with which locations were depicted at different points in time, and the table below allows you to examine the individual artworks that are being mapped.
